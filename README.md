# WaSQL development platform written in python
# NOTICE
For now I have decided not to pursue re-writing WaSQL into python.  Instead I have built new features into the PHP WaSQL that allows the developer to embed PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, Bash, or shell languages.  In addition, I have built in all the global variables into the other languages.  These globals can be accessed via USER, SERVER, REQUEST, CONFIG, and PASSTHRU variables built into the implimentation.
