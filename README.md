# WaSQL development platform written in python
# NOTICE
After quite a bit of research, I have decided not to pursue re-writing WaSQL into python.  Instead I have built new features into the PHP WaSQL that allows the developer to embed PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, Bash, or shell languages.  In addition, I have built in all the global variables into the other languages.  These globals can be accessed via USER, SERVER, REQUEST, CONFIG, and PASSTHRU variables built into the implimentation.

Although python is becomming more and more capable it still has a long way to go before it has all the features needed to port WaSQL.  Many are available in a variety of add-ons but most are not native and may never be.
